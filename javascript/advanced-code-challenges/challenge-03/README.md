## Approach & Efficiency

A binary search method is highly efficient and has a time complexity of O(logN) and space complexity of O(1). This is much faster and more efficient than looping through an array and checking each value against the key. Imagine if an array of millions of bits of data needed to be searched through. With a binary search, half the array is ignored after the first check.
