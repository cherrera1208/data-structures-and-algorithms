# Challenge Summary

The challenge requires me to manipulate a linked list data structure in three ways. First, I need to append a value to the end of the list. Next, I will add a new value before a given value added. And, lastly, I will add a new value after a given value.

## Approach & Efficiency

I approached the challenge by considering looping through the list as I would with an array, and when the desired value is met, push the newValue in place. The code is efficient if no other loops have to be nested
