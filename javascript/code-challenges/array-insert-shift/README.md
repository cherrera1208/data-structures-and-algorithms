# Insert to Middle of an Array

this challenge asks that I insert a new array into an already established array. Basically, I need to write a function that mimics the `.splice` method, but ***without*** built-in JavaScript methods.

## Approach & Efficiency

My approach was to first follow the whiteboarding procedures of establishing the problem domain, drawing visuals, and writing an algorithm in pseudocode. The problem domain ensures I pinpoint the important elements of the problem and ask myself any questions that may improve my understanding or possibly become an issue later. The visuals help to  bring the ideas to life and gives a reliable reference for later sticking points. Finally, during the algorithm pseudocode portion, I attempted to unravel fragments of the function that were starting to develop in my head. Like the visual, it serves to get ideas on "paper" in a concise, easy to read paragraph.
