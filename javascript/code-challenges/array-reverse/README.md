# Reverse an Array

the goal of this challenge is to take an array of numbers, possibly in a random order, and return the array in the exact reverse order ***without using built-in methods***.

## Approach & Efficiency

I approached this challenge by first asking the question of *what* and *how* to return. I confirmed that only numbers, not strings or a combination, would be returned. Then I decided that returning the same array would be most efficient. Next, I visualized the array as numbered dots with their corresponding index and drew the process of the dots being swapped. Last, I wrote a function as pseudocode to show the logic of a while loop.
